This code is a simple console-based paddle and ball game. Here’s an explanation of its components:
Components and Functions:
1.	gotoxy(int x, int y):
o	Moves the cursor to the specified coordinates (x, y) on the console.
o	Uses Windows-specific libraries (windows.h and conio.h), so it will only work on Windows OS.
2.	drawBoard(int paddleX, int ballX, int ballY, int score, int lives):
o	Clears the screen and draws the paddle, ball, and game walls.
o	Displays the score and the remaining lives.
3.	Main Game Loop in main():
o	Initializes the console window size to 30 lines by 60 columns.
o	Sets the initial positions and directions for the paddle and ball, as well as the score and lives.
o	Displays the instructions for controlling the paddle and how to quit the game.
o	Contains a loop that keeps running as long as the player has lives remaining.
4.	Game Mechanics:
o	Uses _kbhit() and _getch() to detect keyboard input for paddle movement.
o	Adjusts the paddle position based on left (75) and right (77) arrow key inputs.
o	Updates the ball’s position and checks for collisions with the walls and paddle.
o	The game ends when the ball drops below the paddle, resulting in a life loss; when lives reach zero, the game is over.
5.	Ending the Game:
o	When lives run out, it clears the screen and displays "Game Over!" with the final score.
Instructions to Run
This game requires a C++ compiler compatible with Windows-specific libraries. To run:
•	Compile and execute in a Windows environment.
•	Move the paddle using the left and right arrow keys.
•	Press Esc to quit the game at any time.
Potential Improvements
•	Adding different levels or increasing the ball speed as the score increases.
•	Adding sound effects for better user experience.
•	Enhancing collision detection for a more realistic ball response.
Example of Expected Output
The console will display walls around the screen's edges, the paddle at the bottom, and the ball moving around. The score and lives will appear on the right side, with "Game Over" and the final score displayed when the game ends.
